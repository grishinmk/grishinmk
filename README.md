Cybersecurity Professional Statement
I am a dedicated cybersecurity professional with a strong foundation in security principles, threat analysis, risk management, and incident response. I successfully completed the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, gaining hands-on experience with security tools such as SIEM, intrusion detection systems, and endpoint protection.

Through this certification, I developed practical skills in identifying vulnerabilities, analyzing security incidents, and implementing protective measures to secure networks and systems. My expertise includes working with Linux, Python, and security frameworks like NIST and ISO 27001.

I am passionate about continuously expanding my knowledge in cybersecurity, staying updated with emerging threats, and applying my skills to protect digital assets. I am actively building my cybersecurity portfolio on GitHub to showcase projects, threat-hunting analyses, and security implementations.

I am eager to leverage my skills in a professional setting, contribute to a security team, and further develop my expertise in the ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape..
